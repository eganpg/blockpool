		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-3 about_body">
				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p>The leader of the pack wants to start a blockpool, so they do. Then they invite you to pick squares. You do. Everyone has more fun during the game.</p>

				<h3>Who can start a blockpool?</h3>
				<p>Anyone with a friend or family member can start a blockpool. It is in fact possible to have a solo blockpool, but we don't recommend it.</p>

				<p>You are already on our site, so look in the top right-hand corner. Click the 'PLAY' button. If you don't already have a referral code, start your own blockpool...and make more friends. </p>
